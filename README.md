Helix SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance
=============================
[![Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/cloudposse.svg?style=social&label=%40my_helix)](https://twitter.com/my_helix)

HelixÂ® is currently working with public health agencies to sequence COVID-19 samples to monitor evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Note that `positivity_by_time.csv` and `positivity_by_age.csv` are the only datasets currently being updated. 

The files `counts_by_state.csv` and `sequencing_results.csv` are **not up to date**. 

For Helix's latest SARS-CoV-2 variant frequencies, please see the [Helix COVID-19 Surveillance Dashboard](https://helix.com/covid19db).

## ðŸ“š Datasets

### positivity_by_time.csv ðŸ“ƒ
- This file contains positivity rates for COVID-19 and FluA from Helix's diagnostic testing operation. Helix's diagnostic test simultaneously assays for COVID-19 and Flu.

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| collection_date | Date sample collected |
| positive_result | Diagnostic test result |
| positive_tests | Number of tests with that test result |
| total_tests | Total number of tests collected that day |
| positivity | Positivity rate corresponding to test result |
| positivity_7day | 7-day rolling average positivity rate |

### positivity_by_age.csv ðŸ“ƒ
- This file contains 7-day rolling average positivity rates for COVID-19 and FluA, by age group, from Helix's diagnostic testing operation. Helix's diagnostic test simultaneously assays for COVID-19 and Flu.

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| age_bin | Age group: <18, 18-24, 25-44, 45-64, and â‰¥65 year-olds |
| collection_date | Date sample collected |
| positive_result | Diagnostic test result |
| positivity_7day | 7-day rolling average positivity rate |


### counts_by_state.csv ðŸ“ƒ
- This file contains counts of test results aggregated by state and collection date.
- Records with fewer than 3 positives are removed to protect privacy.
- All records have a qPCR quantification cycle (Cq) of less than 27 for the N gene target.

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| state | Patient state of residence |
| collection_date | Date of specimen collection |
| positive | Number of positive test results |
| all_SGTF | Number of positive test results with S gene target failure |
| sequenced_SGTF | Number of sequenced test results with S gene target failure |
| B117 | Number of positive test results that were sequenced and known to be of the B.1.1.7 lineage |

### sequencing_results.csv ðŸ“ƒ
- This file contains metadata for individual sequenced specimens, including GenBank Accession numbers and other [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Nucleotide&VirusLineage_ss=SARS-CoV-2,%20taxid:2697049) metadata to facilitate retrieval of the viral genome sequence data.
- Samples without GenBank Accession numbers have been sequenced but are not yet submitted to or approved by GenBank.

| Column Name | Description |
